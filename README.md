# web-traffic-transformation
Data processing pipeline to transform web traffic data to aggregate by user_id

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to aggregate web traffic data across multiple CSV files into a single, consolidated view that highlights user engagement across different pages of a website.
The orignal data files have web traffic data in a time-record format, where each row represents a page view. The transformed data would aggregate data for each user_id where each row represents a different user, with columns indicating the time spent on each webpage (path).
